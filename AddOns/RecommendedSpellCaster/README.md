# Recommended Spell Caster

This work is devoted to God.

This addon provides functionality for casting the next recommended spell or item that [Hekili](https://github.com/Hekili/hekili) recommends.
It works with the [NoName unlocker](https://no-name.site/) or [GMR](https://gmrwow.com/app/pricing).

## Usage

### Via macro

Create a macro with the content:

```
/script castRecommendedSpell()
```

Then you can bind the macro to a key and cast each spell of the rotation with one key.

### Integrated into a script

Just call `castRecommendedSpell()` where it fits in your script.
